# Personal Portfolio 2021
I decided to do something pretty interesting with my portfolio this time around. I haven't got much commercial experience with React.js so decided to do something not so straightforward to show off a bit.

I am happy with how it turned out, I will probably make some small changes to it in the future but sticking to the "perfect is the emeny of good" philosophy. I could keep working on this for weeks making small changes but hoping to get an exciting job soon!
